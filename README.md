Hello Everyone!
Im Bryant Mauricio Varela Escamilla from Nuevo Leon Mexico,
This is my results on the QA Challenge, I focus both on manual QA and on automation, right now im learning again JAVA from scratch
because I really want to learn the most efficient tools available right now and understand what i did not catch on my school days.

I found several bugs that break the whole experience, they are located on each Test Case I created on "Notes and Test Cases" and on the doc file i added
if you want more details about them please feel free to ask me about it! 

I want to keep learning and improving my work, im far from done with selenium/java and automation in general since new tools and technologies are being developed
and i want to be on top of all of that.

Im really glad that you guys decided to look out for me for your next senior qa position and i would like to prove my value and fullfil all the duties as expected
